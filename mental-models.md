Annotations about this article: [The ten most useful mental models](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/06/08/best-mental-models/)

### The Margin
The cost of doing something is rarely constant. How much it takes to do one more?
We change things when we push the margin more and more.
The pleasure of doing something repeatedly, and its benefits tend to experience diminishing returns. The cost of doing something, can often decline as long as you practice.
We ask how much it was in the past, when we should be asking how much it costs for the next step.

### Natural Selection
Understanding natural selection can help you to know which things will spread. And we want to know it, because we can take advantage of it. How and why something will spread?
How can natural selection explain the rapid spread of fake news on social media?
_"All you need is faithful copying which preserves infrequent mistakes, and for the content of what is copied to have some influence on its own survival"._

### Signaling
Signaling is taking visible actions to change what other people think. It's a form of communicate something to make the receiver benefit the signaller. The fact that you can just fake the signals, create incentives for the possibles signallers to choose things that make lying harder.
Ex.: Bedsheets in a hotel are white, typically, because patterned sheets hide stains. If you're worried about cleanliness, a pristine white sheet is harder do fake.
We tend to be suspicious of signaling, as it feels less authentic. But it is likely embedded into our psychology at a very basic level. Much of our behavior may be optimized for sending signals, rather than merely reaching direct ends.
